# Laboratory II
Laboratory II is one of my university courses. It is divided into six experiments. In this repository, I will report only five of them since Circuit 3 will be viewed separately as something more particular.

## Circuit 1
Let's set as the objectives of the experiment the verification of Ohm's law, for a resistor and for composite resistors, and the current-voltage characterization of a nonlinear device. Finally, we will analyze a resistive divider and study under what conditions maximum power transfer occurs to the load. If you ared interested too see the findings, please check [here]().

## Circuit 2
The general objective of this experiment is to understand the operation of RLC circuits under pulsed current conditions. First, by studying individually the capacitance and inductance components in RC and RL circuits. Then, by analyzing circuits that include both components under critical damping, over-damping, and under-damping conditions. If you want to see our results, please check [here]()

## Interferometer
In this experiment, we study the phenomenon of interference. We begin with verifying the law that describes the interference maxima in the Fabry-Perot configuration. Then, we verify the calibration of the micrometer using both the aforementioned configuration and that of Michelson. Subsequently, remaining in the latter configuration, we proceed with a series of measurements related to the refractive index of two media. Finally, we observe that the interference pattern can also be produced when the "obstacles" encountered by light have dimensions much larger than the wavelength, such as the spacing between the markings on a ruler.

## Spectrometer
The purpose of the experiment is, firstly, to study the prism and the grating using lamps containing vapors of known gases, and subsequently, to identify a gas based on its characteristic emission lines.

## Microwave
In this experiment, our aim is to study microwaves, which are electromagnetic waves with a wavelength of approximately 2.85 cm, thus located in a frequency region different from that of the visible spectrum. The study will be conducted through various experiments aimed at identifying the patterns that describe these waves and measuring characteristic quantities such as wavelength.

>[!NOTE]
>The reason why there's a difference between the published script and the research mentioned is because we worked on this project as a group, so we divided the tasks among us. We'll try to create a collaboration soon to give you the full project.
